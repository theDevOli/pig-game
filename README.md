# Pig is a simple dice game first described in print by John Scarne in 1945. Players take turns to roll a single dice as many times as they wish, adding all roll results to a running total, but losing their gained score for the turn if they roll a 1. As with many games of folk origin, Pig is played with many rule variations, including the use of two dice instead of one. Commercial variants of two-dice Pig include Pass the Pigs, Pig Dice, and Skunk. Pig is commonly used by mathematics teachers to teach probability concepts.

## If the player rolls a 1, they score nothing and it becomes the next player's turn.

## If the player rolls any other number, it is added to their turn total and the player's turn continues.

## f a player chooses to "hold", their turn total is added to their score, and it becomes the next player's turn.

## The first player to score 100 or more points wins.
